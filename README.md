# cutAndShuffleText
For fun I made this script that cuts up a text 
in chunks random number of words
, and puts out a new text after shuffling the chunks. 
Your favorite poem will never look the same!

cool to see this with a GUI where you could drop initial text and shuffle
it with the press of a button, seeing the result text in the same window.
